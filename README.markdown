Vim Chuck-Norris
================

I really really needed a Chuck Norris vim plugin, but I couldn't find one on
the internet.

it uses <leader>z to show a Chuck Norris quote.
Of course in the next version this will be configurable, if I'm not roundhoused
to death first...

Make sure you `:call pathogen#helptags()` after installing to make Vim notice
the new documentation file.
